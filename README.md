The majority of my project was based on around this codepen:

The final product looks really cool, but I do apologize for mixing jquery with vanilla javascript. It all works fine I'm just not sure this is a best practice. 

Other resources were W3schools and stackoverflow for references and questions.

I had no major issues completing the assignment
