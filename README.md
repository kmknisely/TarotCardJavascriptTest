The majority of my project was based on around this codepen:
https://codepen.io/tatsin/pen/VQMmPr

The final product looks really cool, but I do apologize for mixing jquery with vanilla javascript. It all works fine I'm just not sure this is a best practice. It also meant that it was easiest for me to code desktop first rather than mobile first, which again I know isn't a best practice but I felt it was best for the assignment. 

Other resources were W3schools and stackoverflow for references and questions.

I had no major issues completing the assignment
